# egg-shell
A place for me to implement my knowledge from CS377 Operating Systems in one place.

I will try my best to avoid copying straight from the projects assigned to us as students.
Here is a list of what projects I have completed thus far and will inevitably pull inspiration
from:

*Inverted Index: Create an ordered index of words with what file they occur in. Uses streams,
sets, and maps specifically. This was a cool first project.

*Tiny Shell: This one is the main draw of inspiration. Functions as a shell that sits on top of
the kernel and can call any most man calls using execvp, fork, and wait. Egg shell will attempt
to use its own library of calls, and maybe some calls to the kernel as well.
